One thing that hit me in the JS community is that most of the blogs and content focus on problems, and attempts to implement functionality which failed. We don’t get this very often in the data science/engineering world. Now, if that was because the whole JS language is one big problem made bearable only via sucessive layers of questionably performant shims - cough, React - it wouldn’t be me who pointed that out…`}</p>\n    <p>{`So you should expect to see quite a volume of cynicism - hopefully delivered in variety and at high velocity.
